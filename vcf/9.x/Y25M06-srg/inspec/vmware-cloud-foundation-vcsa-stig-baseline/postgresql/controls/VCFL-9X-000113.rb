  title 'The VMware Cloud Foundation vCenter PostgreSQL service must log all client disconnections.'
  desc  "
    Disconnection may be initiated by the user or forced by the system (as in a timeout) or result from a system or network failure. To the greatest extent possible, all disconnections must be logged.

    For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to know how long a user's (or other principal's) connection to PostgreSQL lasts. This can be achieved by recording disconnections, in addition to logons/connections, in the audit logs.

    As a database administrator, perform the following at the command prompt:

    # /opt/vmware/vpostgres/current/bin/psql -U postgres -A -t -c \"SHOW log_disconnections;\"

    Example result:

    on

    If the \"log_disconnections\" setting is not configured to \"on\", this is a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    A script is included with vCenter to generate a PostgreSQL STIG configuration.

    As a database administrator, perform the following at the command prompt:

    # chmod +x /opt/vmware/vpostgres/current/bin/vmw_vpg_config/vmw_vpg_config.py
    # /opt/vmware/vpostgres/current/bin/vmw_vpg_config/vmw_vpg_config.py --action stig_enable --pg-data-dir /storage/db/vpostgres
    # chmod -x /opt/vmware/vpostgres/current/bin/vmw_vpg_config/vmw_vpg_config.py

    Restart the PostgreSQL service by running the following command:

    # vmon-cli --restart vmware-vpostgres
