    For each virtual machine do the following:

    From the vSphere Client, right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit Settings >> Advanced Parameters.

    Verify the \"isolation.tools.copy.disable\" value is set to \"true\".

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESX host or vCenter server, run the following command:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name isolation.tools.copy.disable

    If the virtual machine advanced setting \"isolation.tools.copy.disable\" exists and is not set to \"true\", this is a finding.

    If the virtual machine advanced setting \"isolation.tools.copy.disable\" does not exist, this is not a finding.

    For each virtual machine do the following:

    From the vSphere Client, right-click the Virtual Machine and go to Edit Settings >> Advanced Parameters.

    Find the \"isolation.tools.copy.disable\" value and set it to \"true\".

    If the setting does not exist no action is needed.

    or

    From a PowerCLI command prompt while connected to the ESX host or vCenter server, run the following command:

    Get-VM \"VM Name\" | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name isolation.tools.copy.disable | Set-AdvancedSetting -Value true

    Note: The VM must be powered off to configure the advanced settings through the vSphere Client. Therefore, it is recommended to configure these settings with PowerCLI as this can be done while the VM is powered on. Settings do not take effect via either method until the virtual machine is cold started, not rebooted.
